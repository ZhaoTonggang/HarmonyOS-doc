## Overview<a name="section11660541593"></a>

OpenHarmony provides a Natural User Interface \(NUI\) for you to interact with your users. Unlike conventional categorization of input methods, OpenHarmony combines input methods of different dimensions into multimodal inputs, so you can easily arm your application with multi-dimensional, natural interaction features by using the application framework and system built-in UI components or APIs.

Specifically, OpenHarmony currently supports traditional input methods such as key and touch inputs.
