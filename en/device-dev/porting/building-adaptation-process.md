For details about compilation and building, see  [Compilation and Building](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/device-dev/subsystems/compilation-and-building.md). When adding third-party chips, perform the following steps to complete building adaptation:

## Building Adaptation Process<a name="section2159183845319"></a>

You need to create a directory for the development board. Taking the  **RTL8720**  development board of SoC provider Realtek for example, the  **device/realtek/rtl8720**  directory must be created. To complete the building adaptation, perform the following steps:

1.  Configure the toolchain and building options.

    The  **ohos-clang**  toolchain is used by default. SoC providers can also customize the configuration based on their development boards. The building-related variables in the building configuration file of the development board are described as follows:

    -   **kernel\_type**: kernel type used by the development board, for example,  **"liteos\_a"**,  **"liteos\_m"**, or  **"linux"**.
    -   **kernel\_version**: kernel version used for development, for example,  **"4.19"**.
    -   **board\_cpu**: CPU type of the development board, for example,  **"cortex-a7"**  or  **"riscv32"**.
    -   **board\_arch**: chip architecture of the development board, for example,  **"armv7-a"**  or  **"rv32imac"**.
    -   **board\_toolchain**: name of the customized building toolchain used by the development board, for example,  **"gcc-arm-none-eabi"**. If this variable is not specified,  **ohos-clang**  will be used by default.
    -   **board\_toolchain\_prefix**: prefix of the building toolchain, for example,  **"gcc-arm-none-eabi"**.
    -   **board\_toolchain\_type**: building toolchain type. Currently, GNU compiler collection \(GCC\) and clang are supported, for example,  **"gcc"**  or  **"clang"**.
    -   **board\_cflags**: building options of the  **.c**  file configured for the development board.
    -   **board\_cxx\_flags**: building options of the  **.cpp**  file configured for the development board.
    -   **board\_ld\_flags**: link options configured for the development board.

        The corresponding  **config.gni**  file will be loaded based on the development board selected by the product. The variables in this file are globally visible to system components.


    Taking the RTL8720 development board of Realtek as an example, the  **device/realtek/rtl8720/liteos\_m/config.gni**  file is configured as follows:

    ```
    # Kernel type, e.g. "linux", "liteos_a", "liteos_m".
    kernel_type = "liteos_m"
    
    # Kernel version.
    kernel_version = "3.0.0"
    
    # Board CPU type, e.g. "cortex-a7", "riscv32".
    board_cpu = "real-m300"
    
    # Board arch, e.g. "armv7-a", "rv32imac".
    board_arch = ""
    
    # Name of the toolchain that is used for system building
    # E.g. gcc-arm-none-eabi, arm-linux-harmonyeabi-gcc, ohos-clang, riscv32-unknown-elf.
    # Note: The "ohos-clang" toolchain is used by default. You can also customize the toolchain.
    board_toolchain = "gcc-arm-none-eabi"
    
    # Path where the toolchain is installed, which can be left blank if the installation path has been added to ~/.bashrc.
    board_toolchain_path =
        rebase_path("//prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin",
                    root_build_dir)
    
    # Prefix of the toolchain
    board_toolchain_prefix = "gcc-arm-none-eabi-"
    
    # Type of the toolchain
    board_toolchain_type = "gcc"
    
    # Building flags related to the board
    board_cflags = []
    board_cxx_flags = []
    board_ld_flags = []
    ```

2.  Edit the building script of the development board.

    For a newly added development board, the  **BUILD.gn**  file that functions as the entry for building must be added to the board directory. Taking the RTL8720 development board of Realtek as an example, the content in the  **device/realtek/rtl8720/BUILD.gn**  file is as follows:

    ```
    group("rtl8720") {
      ...
    }
    ```

3.  Build and debug the development board.

    1. Run the  **hb set**  command in any directory to set the source code path and the product to build.

    2. Run the  **hb build**  command in the development board directory to start the building.

4.  Build and debug the product.

    Write the development board and component information to the product configuration file. Fields in the configuration file are as follows:

    -   **product\_name**: product name, which can be customized. It is recommended that the value be the same as the level-3 directory name under the  **vendor**  directory.
    -   **ohos\_version**: OpenHarmony version number, which must be the same as the actual version number.
    -   **device\_company**: name of the chip solution vendor. It is recommended that the value be the same as the level-2 directory name under the  **device**  directory.
    -   **board**: name of the development board. It is recommended that the value be the same as the level-3 directory name under the  **device**  directory.
    -   **kernel\_type**: kernel type, which must match the kernel type supported by the development board.
    -   **kernel\_version**: kernel version, which must match the kernel version supported by the development board.
    -   **subsystem**: OpenHarmony subsystem selected for the product. For details about the subsystems supported by OpenHarmony, see the descriptions of the subsystems in the  **build/lite/components**  directory.
    -   **components**: subsystem-specific components selected for the product. For details about the components supported by the selected subsystem, see the  **build/lite/components/_Specific subsystem_.json**  file.
    -   **features**: component-specific features configured for the product. For details about the features supported by the selected component, see the  **features**  field of the component in  **build/lite/components/_Specific subsystem_.json**  file.

    Taking the Wi-Fi IoT module based on the RTL8720 development board as an example, the  **vendor/my\_company/wifiiot/config.json**  file is as follows:

    ```
    {
        "product_name": "wifiiot",                        # Product name
        "ohos_version": "OpenHarmony 1.0",                # In-use OS version
        "device_company": "realtek",                      # Name of the chip solution vendor
        "board": "rtl8720",                               # Name of the development board
        "kernel_type": "liteos_m",                        # Selected kernel type
        "kernel_version": "3.0.0",                        # Selected kernel version
        "subsystems": [                            
          {
            "subsystem": "kernel",                        # Selected subsystem
            "components": [
              { "component": "liteos_m", "features":[] }  # Selected component and its features
            ]
          },
          ...
          {
             More subsystems and components
          }
        ]
    }
    ```
