# WELCOME TO OPENHARMONY
This project stores OpenHarmony documentation, including the quick start guide, development guides, and API reference. We appreciate your contribution to the OpenHarmony documentation.

## Motivation
Traditional OSs are limited to a specific type of device, while OpenHarmony provides distributed features that are compatible with a wide range of different devices. The first version supports devices with 128 KB to 128 MB of memory. Join us as we keep updating OpenHarmony versions.
For device developers, OpenHarmony utilizes a component-based design to tailor its features to better suit specific devices, based on each device's capabilities and service characteristics. OpenHarmony can run on devices with limited resources and wearables with hundreds of KB of memory, as well as more powerful devices, such as smart home cameras and dashcams with hundreds of MB of memory.
